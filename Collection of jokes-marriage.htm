  Marriage is a three ring circus: --engagement ring ---wedding ring<br>
  ---suffering<br>
  <br>
  **************************************<br>
  <br>
  When a newly married couple smiles, everyone knows why. When a ten-year<br>
  married couple smiles, everyone wonders why.<br>

  Love is blind but marriage is an eye-opener.<br>

  When a man opens the door of his car for his wife, you can be sure of<br>
  one thing: either the car is new or the wife.<br>

  I take my wife everywhere, but she keeps finding her way back.<br>
  <br>
  **************************************<br>
  <br>
  I asked my wife, &quot;Where do you want to go for our anniversary?&quot; She<br>
  said, &quot;Somewhere I have never been!&quot; I told her, &quot;How about the
  kitchen?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  **************************************<br>
  <br>
  We always hold hands. If I let go, she shops.<br>

  She ran after the garbage truck, yelling, &quot;Am I too late for the<br>
  garbage?&quot;Following her down the street I yelled, &quot;No, jump in!&quot;<br>

  BaddTeddy recently explained to me why he refuses to ever get married.<br>
  He says &quot;the wedding rings look too much like minature
  handcuffs.....&quot;<br>

  If your dog is barking at the back door and your wife is yelling at the<br>
  front door, who do you let in first? The Dog of course...at least he'll<br>
  shut up after you let him in!<br>

  #CASE 1 : Getting married is like going to a restaurant with friends.<br>
  You order what you want, then when you see what the other fellow has,<br>
  you wish you had ordered that.<br>
  #CASE 2 : At the cocktail party, one woman said to another, &quot;Aren't you<br>
  wearing your wedding ring on the wrong finger??&quot; The other replied,<br>
  &quot;Yes, I am. I married the wrong man.&quot;<br>
  #CASE 3 : Before a man is married, he is incomplete. Then when he is<br>
  married, he is finished.<br>
  #CASE 4 Marriage is an institution in which a man losses his bachelor's<br>
  degree and the woman gets her master's status.<br>
  #CASE 5 A little boy asked his father, &quot;Daddy, how much does it cost to<br>
  get married??&quot; And the father replied, &quot;I don't know son, I'm still<br>
  paying off<br>
