  unknowingly caught in an automated speed trap that measured his speed using
  radar and photographed his car. He later received in the mail a ticket for $40
  and a photo of his car. Instead of payment, he sent the police department a
  photograph of $40. Several days later, he received a letter from the police
  that contained another picture, this time of handcuffs. He immediately mailed
  in his $40.</font><strong><font color="#ff0000" face="Arial" size="2"><br>
